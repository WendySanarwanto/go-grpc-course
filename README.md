# go-grpc-course

A sample of `gRPC` service code exercise, taken from Udemy's [gRPC [Golang] Master Class: Build Modern API & Microservices](https://www.udemy.com/grpc-golang/), authored by [Stephane Maarek](https://github.com/simplesteph). The `gRPC` in this sample, is a simple __Unary__ typed service which return a greet message, therefore we don't use `stream` yet on it.
